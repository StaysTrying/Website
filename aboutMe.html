         <p align="center" class="par"> Hello World! My name is Tyler Krawec and I am studying to become a software engineer at 
            Florida Gulf Coast University. I chose to study engineering <br>because I enjoy hands on work that requires outside-the-box thinking. 
            I am hoping to focus on the security aspect of software engineering and use my <br>coding ability to ramp up security measures for 
            companies that require my assistance. Im still a fairly inexperienced code, <br>but with a good work ethic I belive I will be an 
            <strong>asset</strong> to companies in the future.

	       <h2 class="header"> Usability <h2>
	       <p class= "par"> While coding this site, I used Notepad++ to create/edit the elements, then uploaded the files to my github repository. Working with a local copy made changing the visual properties of my website a lot easier because I did not have to wait for the github server to recognize the changes made in order to see them. The goal for this website is to practice my coding abilities and to create a portfolio that might get noticed by possible employers. My video is a brief summary of what you can expect to see throughout my website and why I put it there. There is a second page added to my website that is filled with even more information about me and what I accomplished so far while studying software engineering. I gave my website a unique layout and designed it around my univeristy to try and show some school pride. Please feel free to click any of the links below to learn some more about me! </p>
