	       <p> For this website, I did the majority of my coding on Notepad ++, then uploaded the files to my github repository. This made making visual changes to my website a lot easier. The goal for this website is to put my name out there and to gain the interest of possible emplyers. I also linked another page with more information about me to give you a better idea of who I am. </p>
